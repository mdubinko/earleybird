# Human comprehensibilty

- For all new and updated code, carefully consider how to make it extremely human comprehensible

# TODO File Management

- Always read `TODO.txt` at session start
- Reference TODO items when suggesting or planning work
- Auto-update TODO.txt after completing tasks
- Add new issues discovered while coding

## TODO Format

- `- [ ]` incomplete, `- [x]` complete; Include file paths: `(src/auth.js:45)`
- Suffix tags for priority or anything else: `#HIGH` `#MED` `#LOW`; or `#techdebt`, etc.

## Workflow

- TODO.txt is for multi-session issues; not immediate work at hand
- Mention when adding, modifying, working on, or marking items done
- Break down COMPLEX tasks

# WebAssembly

- Always ensure that we are producing code that can target WebAssembly (this does not include test harnesses or suites)
