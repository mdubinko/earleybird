# hackles
Experimental implementation of ixml in Rust. Currently targeting the 20220620 spec.

Why "hackles"? This project is conceptually related to my prior work, and the animal on the cover of my O'Reilly book was a Vulturine Guinea Fowl. The most notable feature of that bird: it's distinctive plumage, particularly the hackles.
